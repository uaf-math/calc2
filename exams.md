## Exams

The table below gives the date and coverage for upcoming Exams.  <b>The best guides to the content of an Exam are the [Quizzes](quizzes.html) leading up to the Exam, and also the [Homework assignments](homework.html).</b>  Also see the [Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTJV11ILVouSFriJJQo6VS7-qBGvXBt6gtQNPTmmScJuiknursixGxHQf12yrBgwkJqETFn31EgQRia/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).

Links to the Exams themselves ("blank"), and their solutions, will appear here as soon after the exam itself as possible.

<b>Old Exams appear below!</b>

### Older practice materials

#### Practice Midterm 1

Your best guide to what Midterm 1 is like is to look at all the previous Quizzes, and the Homework problems.  However, while the Quizzes did not cover sections 3.3 and 3.4, these sections <b>are</b> on Midterm 1.  The following Practice Exam, found on the web, is not perfectly aligned to our schedule/sections but it is reasonably close.
* [Practice Midterm 1 (SUNY Stony Brook)](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~ddudko/mat132-fall21/Midterm1Practice.pdf) <em><-- ignore Problem 6</em>
  * [Solutions to above Practice Problems (SUNY Stony Brook)](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~ddudko/mat132-fall21/Midterm1PracticeSol.pdf)

#### Practice Midterm 2

Again, your best guide to Midterm 2 is to look at the previous Quizzes, and the Homework problems.  The following old "Exam 3" is not perfectly aligned to our schedule/sections, but it is reasonably close to our Midterm 2.  You should expect additional problems from sections 3.6, 3.7, and 4.1.

#### Final Exams from old semesters

The material on these old Final Exams is close to, but not perfectly reflective of, what will be on our Final Exam this semester.  In fact, I will build our Final by looking at the kinds of problems I asked on Homework, Quizzes, and Midterm Exams.
