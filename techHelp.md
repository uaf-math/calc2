## Homework
* Homework will be uploaded through Gradescope which you will access from inside Canvas.

	- If your file takes a long time to upload, make sure your scan is not too big. I recommend using black-and-white scans (unless you are using color in your work, in which case please use color scans) made through a dedicated smartphone scanning app (see below) rather than just trying to upload a photo. 
	- Don't just print to pdf; usually computers or applications have export to pdf options that produce more optimized files.
	- Gradescope has a [guide to submitting homework](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf).

## Scanning
	
* Use your smartphone to scan: [GeniusScan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan/) is a good choice. The (free) basic version should be fine. Works nicely for both iPhone and Android. When possible, set your scans to black-and-white, so that they are smaller and therefore easier to upload.
	- Click the orange + button to start a scan
	- in the upper right, you can toggle between single and batch (for multipage scans). For assignments with multiple pages, you will need to take a multiple-page scan (Gradescope expects you to upload a single PDF for a given assignment).
	- Usually it's pretty good at choosing, but to force black-and-white, go to the settings gear, select "Default Filter" and you can select either black-and-white or color.
	- Sometimes students find it's helpful to tack up work vertically (say, on a refrigerator) to avoid glare
	- *Double-check your scan* before you upload it, to make sure it's readable!

* If you're using a dedicated scanner, follow the instructions. Then check your scan.

## Printing 

* UAF Printers: [this page](https://www.alaska.edu/files/oit/services/printing_support/Pharos-Setup.pdf) has information from UAF OIT about student printing, including how to access but I don't know how up-to-date it is.

In addition, there is a student-accessible printer in the Chapman Computer Lab (CHAP 103). You will need to swipe your PolarExpress card at the Student Printer in order to print, and there will be a charge (you will use your Bear Bucks to pay for printing).


## CircleIn

UAF is piloting an online forum for class discussion called [CircleIn](https://circleinapp.com/). It has a variety of incentives to encourage participation. Access is easy. When you log in, CircleIn will know your classes. Note that instructors do *not* have access to CircleIn and will not see any posts or participate in any discussions.
