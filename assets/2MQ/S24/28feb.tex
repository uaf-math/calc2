Integrate and simplify:
    $$\int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx= \hspace{2.5in}$$

\vspace{1.0in}\noindent
Your answer should have only the ``$b$'' variable in it.

\noindent
Now compute the limit
    $$\lim_{b\to\infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx= \hspace{2.5in}$$

This is the entire idea behind improper integrals!
