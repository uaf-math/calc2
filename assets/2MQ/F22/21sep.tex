Try this indefinite integral by substitution, and see how that fails:
    $$\int x \cos(x)\,dx = \hspace{2.0in}$$
Now check that this derivative is correct:
    $$\Big(x\,\sin(x)\Big)' = \sin(x) + x \cos(x)$$
(It is the product rule, of course.)  Finally, integrate both sides of the last equation, simplifying everything you can.  You will get an answer for the first indefinite integral!
