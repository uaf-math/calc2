We do not know how to do the following definite integral by finding an antiderivative.  However, we do know the values of $\cos x$ at the particular values $x=0$ and $x=\pi/2$.  Use these values to estimate the integral.  You also know $\cos(\pi/4)$; can you improve your estimate?

  $$\int_0^{\pi/2} (\cos x)^{1/2} \,dx = \hspace{2.5in}$$
