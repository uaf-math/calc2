\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the region $R$ bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$, $y=0$, and $x=4.$ Determine the volume of the solid with cross-sections perpendicular to the base and parallel to the $y$-axis are squares. Attempt to describe and/or draw what this solid looks like.\\
\vfill

\item A general formula for volume using slices:

\vspace{1in}

\item Sketch the same region as in problem 1 above (i.e. the region $R$ bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$, $y=0$, and $x=4$). Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating this region about the $x$-axis. Attempt to describe and/or draw what this solid looks like.\\

\item The Disk Method

\vspace{1.5in}
\newpage
\item Sketch the region bounded by $y=x^{2/3}$ (sketched below), $x=0$ and $y=1.$ Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating this region about the $y$-axis. Attempt to describe and/or draw what this solid looks like.\\

\item Sketch the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=x^2$. Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating this region about the $x$-axis. Attempt to describe and/or draw what this solid looks like.\\

\item The Washer Method

\vspace{1in}


\item Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the $y$ axis the region bounded by $y=x^2$ and $y=4x.$ (Sketch the region. Draw a slice.)
