## Worksheets (and Matlab codes)

PDFs for Worksheets, and their solutions, will appear here as they occur.  (You **do not** have to turn-in any Worksheet! The purpose of worksheets is to keep us efficient and active in-class.)

This is also the place to find Matlab codes which I used in occasional demonstrations.  You can use either [Matlab online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) or [Octave online](https://octave-online.net/) to try these codes, or get [Matlab on your own machine](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html).
